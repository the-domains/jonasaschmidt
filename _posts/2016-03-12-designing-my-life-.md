# Designing my life ...

Just got my BETA activation from [http://thegrid.io][0] and want to explore how to build an A.I. powered website. ![A portrait of me, Jonas A. Schmidt](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92014c4e-2419-428f-8283-805398618442.jpg)

Not knowing what to post first -- as I am not too much in favour of Taylor Swift (the wizard suggests to put some photos of her in my first post) -- I flatly decided to start with something I am really passionate about ... design. 
> 
> I love great design! Sustainable, environmentally friendly, socially responsible, long lasting, valuable, maybe hand crafted and unique, but mostly reduced, aesthetic and beautifully designed real life things.

So I'll start to put together a selection of exactly such things here. Things I feel, would add to a "designed" life and I will continue to carefully add to it over time.

Watch out to new posts and feel free to be inspired...
