## I wear my sunglasses at night. ðŸŽ¶ 

For chill-out reasons on a summer holiday or to disguise on hung over days ... good sunglasses are a must from time to time, also as a style item and fashion statement and for eye protection of course. ![Ray Ban Erika (Color: Havana)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f11f79450d620721309394c05644c0331a98217c.jpg)

Apart from classics like _Ray-Ban__Wayfarer_, _Aviator_ or  _Clubmaster_ there's also younger models like the new [_Erika_][0] I like very much for it's vintage style, creating a slight retro look. I comes in black, havana (my favorite and the one I got) and brown that actually looks like nude skin.

But it doesn't always have to be a Ray Ban I guess, the Darmstadt (Germany) based shop [_Klar_][1] offers a hand selected variety of original brands of glasses (not sunglasses only) that is always worth a second look. The selected models have strong character and style and you should let the shop owner find your model for you. He'll know.

Also there is still _[ic! Berlin][2]_ of course and in terms of style never forget  _[Mykita][3]_. Take a look around.

But why I initially started out to write this post is actually because I discovered [_Shwood_][4]. They started out making sunglasses out of hardwood (wow) and recently I read about their [_Badlands Collection_][4] made out of the strangest (and innovative) of resin cast materials like feathers and desert flowers and on top of that they just look awesome!
